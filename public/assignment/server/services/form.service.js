GET /api/assignment/form/:formId

DELETE /api/assignment/form/:formId

POST /api/assignment/user/:userId/form
creates a new form whose properties are the same as the form object embedded in the HTTP request's body and the form belongs to a user whose id is equal to the userId path parameter. The form object's id is initially null since it is a new record. The id of the new form should be set dynamically using Node.js guid or node-uuid libraries. These will eventually be set by the database when they are inserted into a collection
PUT /api/assignment/form/:formId
updates a form object whose id is equal to the formId path parameter so that its properties are the same as the property values of the form object embedded in the request's body
